## Configuration file for a typical tor user
#
# On Unix, Tor will look for this file in someplace like "~/.tor/torrc" or
# "/etc/torrc"
#
# On Windows, Tor will look for the configuration file in someplace like
# "Application Data\tor\torrc" or "Application Data\<username>\tor\torrc"

## Replace this with "SocksPort 0" if you don't want clients to connect.
SocksPort 9050 # what port to advertise for application connections
SocksBindAddress 127.0.0.1 # accept connections only from localhost
#SocksBindAddress 192.168.0.1:9100 # listen on a chosen IP/port

## Entry policies to allow/deny SOCKS requests based on IP address.
## First entry that matches wins. If no SocksPolicy is set, we accept
## all (and only) requests from SocksBindAddress.
#SocksPolicy accept 192.168.0.1/16
#SocksPolicy reject *

## Allow no-name routers (ones that the dirserver operators don't
## know anything about) in only these positions in your circuits.
## Other choices (not advised) are entry,exit,introduction.
AllowUnverifiedNodes middle,rendezvous

## Logs go to stdout at level "notice" unless redirected by something
## else, like one of the below lines. You can have as many log lines as
## you want.
##
## Send all messages of level 'notice' or higher to @LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/tor/notices.log
#Log notice file @LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/tor/notices.log
## Send only debug and info messages to @LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/tor/debug.log
#Log debug-info file @LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/tor/debug.log
## Send ONLY debug messages to @LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/tor/debug.log
#Log debug-debug file @LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/tor/debug.log
## To use the system log instead of Tor's logfiles, uncomment these lines:
#Log notice syslog
## To send all messages to stderr:
#Log debug stderr

## Uncomment this to start the process in the background... or use
## --runasdaemon 1 on the command line.
#RunAsDaemon 1

## Tor only trusts directories signed with one of these keys, and
## uses the given addresses to connect to the trusted directory
## servers. If no DirServer lines are specified, Tor uses the built-in
## defaults (moria1, moria2, tor26), so you can leave this alone unless
## you need to change it.

## The directory for keeping all the keys/etc. By default, we store
## things in $HOME/.tor on Unix, and in Application Data\tor on Windows.
#DataDirectory @LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/tor

## Look in .../hidden_service/hostname for the address to tell people.
## HiddenServicePort x y:z says to redirect a port x request from the

################ This section is just for servers #####################

## NOTE: If you enable these, you should consider mailing your identity
## key fingerprint to the tor-ops, so we can add you to the list of
## servers that clients will trust. See the README for details.

## Required: A unique handle for this server
#Nickname ididnteditheconfig

## The IP or fqdn for this server. Leave blank and Tor will guess.
#Address noname.example.com

#ContactInfo 1234D/FFFFFFFF Random Person <nobody@example.com>

## Required: what port to advertise for tor connections
#ORPort 9001
## If you want to listen on a port other than the one advertised
## in ORPort, uncomment the line below. You'll need to do ipchains
## or other port forwarding yourself to make this work.
#ORBindAddress 0.0.0.0:9090

## Uncomment this to mirror the directory for others (please do)
#DirPort 9030 # what port to advertise for directory connections
## If you want to listen on a port other than the one advertised
## in DirPort, uncomment the line below. You'll need to do ipchains
## or other port forwarding yourself to make this work.
#DirBindAddress 0.0.0.0:9091

## A comma-separated list of exit policies. They're considered first
## to last, and the first match wins. If you want to *replace*
## the default exit policy, end this with either a reject *:* or an
## accept *:*. Otherwise, you're *augmenting* (prepending to) the
## default exit policy. Leave commented to just use the default.
#ExitPolicy accept *:6660-6667
#ExitPolicy reject 192.168.0.1:*
#ExitPolicy reject *:*
